OpenDataHive is inherently an environment designed to streamline personal project management, though its definitive purpose remains fluid. It functions as a spatial, three-dimensional repository for projects—a "GitHub in 3D"—or perhaps a shared, immersive personal desktop.

At its core, it represents a search for new paradigms in communication, aimed at integrating HDC vector compression technology. Whether it evolves into a new standard or remains an experiment, its path is yet to be determined.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   npm install

2. Run the development server:
   npm run dev

3. Build for production:
   npm run build
